<h2>CONFERENCE (Design proposal)</h2> <br /><br /></p>
<p class="lead">
PART I: (Minute 1-7 / 8)<br /><br />

IDEA: What the conference will be about:<br />
OPTION 1: How to invent reality? Or rather, how to generate elements that allow us to manipulate the user to replace his experiential awareness with simulated experiences?<br />
SLIDE: "I feel that the balance between fiction and reality has changed significantly in the last decade, and quickly their roles have been reversed ... It is becoming less and less necessary for man to invent a fictional content." The fiction is already there. of the writer is to invent reality. "J G. Ballard, Crash<br /><br />

OPTION 2: Today, with social media and immersive digital applications, people are connecting the two worlds, real and virtual, in a univocal reality. But still not enough, the goal is to go beyond social collaboration or virtual reality, those visual discourses that seek interactivity and immersion without achieving the suspension of disbelief. The current mechanisms have not achieved or seek to distort the philosophical principle that reality is a construct, in addition to the current human is in search of new digital experiences.<br />
SLIDE: "A screen connected to a digital computer gives us the opportunity to familiarize ourselves with concepts not possible in the physical world. It is a viewer to look towards a world of wonders. "Ivan Sutherland, The ultimate Display (1962)<br /><br />

IDEA: In the year 999, Westerners wondered what would be the changes that would bring the next millennium, most feared because the prophecies and linear readings of the Bible would materialize in a sound Final Judgment, or hoped that utopian ideas would be realized, all so simplistic that our daily life was unimaginable.<br />
SLIDE: APOCALYPSE. MEDIEVAL IMAGE OF THE END OF THE X CENTURY<br /><br />

IDEA: A thousand years later, people lived a less profound psychosis and we asked ourselves what would be the transformations that the new millennium would bring. We were sure there would not be an apocalypse. Fifteen years later, we have surpassed some of the most picturesque expectations.<br />
IDEA: In the twentieth century, even being the shortest century, it had great changes and social moments that mark it as the vertiginous century:<br />
SLIDE: Collage: two world wars, the trip to the moon, the population tripled, time was relativized, a sheep was cloned, climate change, the realization of digital technology, the conception of media arts such as cinema and television, to exemplify).<br /><br />

IDEA: Still, our idea of the future was completely different.<br />
SLIDE: VIDEO ARRIVAL OF MARTY MCFLY (If you have time)<br />
Fortunately, they did not hit the clothes and unfortunately we do not have the flying skateboard that I dreamed of as a child.<br /><br />

IDEA: Still 1999 was a year of revelations. Two films were premiered, let's not forget that cinema is the art of the 20th century, which would reveal this transformation and delimit something that at that moment we could not understand; the two films would define our generation: The Fight Club, by David Fincher and The Matrix, by the Wachowski brothers. The two films share, in addition to a public, the idea of simulation.<br />
SLIDE: WITH VIDEOS<br />
IDEA: The Fight Club: schizophrenic variation, Jack / Tyler Durdeen. Tyler defines himself as a chaotic conspirator of the epoch that looms and poses the supremacy of corporeality over alienation. In it, Tyler stands as a hero to the classic sense of sacrifice for the sake of a better civilization.<br />
IDEA The Matrix: Neo, the protagonist of The Matrix. Matrix is the heroic wizard. Beyond the technological advances, but not narrative, of the film because it prioritizes simulation over reality, the Wachowski brothers suggest that we inhabit a reality simulated by computers, which seems real to us, but that are simply a reflection before the stimuli created by gifted machine beings.<br /><br />


















TENTATIVE INDEX<br />
I:<br />
SIMULATION<br />
Why is it fundamental now<br />
Digital transforms the way of thinking, truth is no longer important but pleasure. Lessing, under that idea, won the art.<br />
What can be simulated<br />
Realities<br />
What is reality<br />
This has been sought through immersion<br />
Literature<br />
It has to go further: duplicate the reality<br />
Borges<br />
Matrix: the imulation of the real<br />
The possibility of achieving it: branson<br />
The current impossibility. Computer necessary to generate a simulation of reality (with presentation, for scale of times and sizes such as TED). Venus<br />
The idea that it is not necessary to simulate everything, only the conscience of some, philosophical idea behind<br />
Failure of virtual reality because your mind always knows that you are not in another real reality, but how that will change quickly.<br /><br />


SIMULAR EXPERIENCE<br />
Is more simple<br />
Process of immersion in the narrative. Video: Amelie in the cinema.<br />
Simulation process, for this it is necessary that the user feels part.<br />
Social networks like the perfect simulation.<br />
History of the Finn who never left home<br /><br />

<h3>NEOTIPO: NARRATIVE SIMULATION OF AN EXPERIENCE</h3><br /><br />

<p class="lead">In the year 999, Westerners wondered what the changes would be that would bring the next millennium, most feared because the prophecies and linear readings of the Bible would materialize in a sound Final Judgment, or hoped that utopian ideas would be realized, all so simplistic that our daily life was unimaginable.<br />
A thousand years later, people lived a less profound psychosis and we asked ourselves what would be the transformations that the new millennium would bring. We were sure there would not be an apocalypse. Fifteen years later, we have surpassed some of the most picturesque expectations. If the twentieth century, even being the shortest century, had great changes and social moments that mark it as the dizzying century: two world wars, the trip to the moon, the population tripled, time was relativized, a sheep was cloned , climate change, the realization of digital technology, the conception of media arts such as film and television, to exemplify). We believed that the end of history had arrived and we considered utopias, that is, after that exhaustive year, the next thing would be to continue with a similar path or, we hoped, a little more calm. How wrong we were. For historians, on September 11, 2001, the century was inaugurated with the collapse of the towers that erected the World Economic Center. But 1999 was a year that determines the change of sociocultural paradigm of the next century.<br />
That year two films would be released, let's not forget that cinema is the art of the 20th century, which would reveal this transformation. Two films that, beyond their aesthetic and artistic value, delimited something that at that moment we could not understand; the two films would define my generation: The Fight Club, by David Fincher and The Matrix, by the Wachowski brothers.
The two films share, in addition to a public, the idea of ​​simulation. In the Fight Club, the schizophrenic variation is posed, when the protagonist, who is the narrator in Chuck Palinuck's novel and in the film receives the name of Jack, creates a model alter ego: Tyler Durdeen. Tyler defines himself as a chaotic conspirator of the epoch that looms and poses the supremacy of corporeality over alienation. In it, Tyler stands as a hero to the classic sense of sacrifice for the sake of a better civilization.<br />
The West is structured on the concept of heroism. Mircea Eliade, in his book Myth and Reality, affirms that History propitiated the overcoming of myth, although mythical thought has not been abolished. Although we inhabit a historical time, where the protagonists are not heroes or gods but human beings, common, affordable, we always look for the hero's idea to pose surmountable challenges and imitable functions.<br />
The concept of the hero has changed. To exemplify it, Jean Starobinski uses the tragedy "Ajax" of Sophocles, where Ajax, furious at not getting the armor of Achilles as a reward for his courage and surrender on the battlefield, plans the death of the Achaeans in revenge, in particular the of Ulises, the winner of the medal. Thanks to Athena simulating the reality of Ajax, in the famous attack of madness where it removes the rams, believing that they are their war mates, Ulysses evades death and dominates the Trojan War. Starobiski argues that behind this election, to reward the strategist on the strong man, is the guiding principle of the political and cultural evolution of societies. This idea of the hero, as the warrior that led the singular combat, would reach its peak in the twentieth century, with the figure of the astronaut, as Tom Wolfe relates in The right stuff, what you have to have.<br />
It is significant that Tyler Durdeen names his group of followers, space monkeys, but the important thing is his transformation as a hero, as he turns from the violent man who faces blows with strangers and allies, to the strategist who wishes to dynamite the consumer society and, In the interim, he creates lapidary phrases. When the movie appeared, we all wanted to be Tyler. We did not know that what he was predicting was the closing of an era, heroic.<br /><br />
FINAL SCENE FIGHT CLUB<br />
When the towers collapsed and all the screens in the world reproduced the fall, we thought it was an audiovisual simulation, not a real footage.<br /><br />
VIDEO 9/11<br />
We did not know that behind the building collapsed a symbolic concept of reality.<br />
Today, we live a paradigm shift, a cultural turn. Maybe for five hundred years there was not a similar one. I know it's too risky a statement. Until three years ago, I believed that this idea reflected only the need (si) of human beings to belong to a memorable epoch. However, now I think we are in a time of great changes that must be analyzed. As for space we can not focus on all the sociocultural transformations that digital art entails, let's stay with the statment launched by Nief Yehya in The Transformed Body, on "the inevitable transition from a human society to a post-human one, as well as the processes that are turning man into a being articulated by technology "(Yehya, 2001: 15).<br />
It closes the heroic stage and gives rise to the magician's time, a mixture between the necromancer and the illusionist. In part, then, if we believe in the power that technology provides and the importance for the current time, we can start from the simulation maker shares the attributes that Cristopher Marlowe provides in his Faust: "But the empire of the one who dominates this is so vast as the human mind: a skillful magician is a semi God. '"(Marlowe: 49). In addition, he is a magician in the sense that he can turn the artifice into a simulation that transcends our notion of reality, as Prospero does.<br />
The heroic magician, for my generation was Neo, the protagonist of The Matrix. Matrix is ​​important, beyond the technological advances, but not narrative, of the film because it prioritizes the simulation of reality. In the film, the Wachowski brothers pose that we inhabit a reality simulated by computers, that seems real to us, but that are simply a reflection before the stimuli created by supernatural machine beings.<br /><br />
REAL MATRIX (until 1:11)<br />
Fifteen years ago, the film dazzled by its fantastic idea. Today, with the rise of the digital world, the user's relationship with the simulation is transformed in a radical way, because it takes it beyond the imagination and gives the creator a chance to manipulate the user to replace his consciousness of experientiality with simulated experiences.<br />
I know that the notion of simulations based on digital advances is not a novel proposal. If in the eighties began to raise mechanisms to conform, with technological devices, the necessary spaces to create simulations of reality; in the last ten years, what has been transformed in recent years is its relevance, because today, with social media and immersive digital applications, people are connecting the two worlds, the real and the virtual, in a mental palimpsest .<br />
I would like to clarify that I approach the idea of ​​simulation in the sense of a narrative in which a user inhabits a reality or experiences an experience, not technological strategies to optimize results.<br />
A simulation is the imitation of a model with such precision that the original and the duplication are confused or comply with the same laws to be observed, in such a way that the observer does not recognize the difference between the original model and the replica. The creation of simulations, not simulations, either of reality or of experience, is fundamental since it would specify one of the maximum functions of the narrative arts that is to allow the user to coexist more than one life, which goes beyond fiction, where the reader takes elements from the world of fiction to implant them in their reality and vice versa.<br />
Therefore, creating simulations would allow all humans to inhabit and realize our desires, even the most unattainable, making our brain believe that this is real, as much as at this moment we dialogue.<br />
This would make us free, if we believe that freedom is based on the responsible choice between possibilities, it would allow us to materialize our desires and perversions without direct affectations to third parties, transforming us. As stated by Ivan Sutherland, in The Ultimate Display (1962) "A screen connected to a digital computer gives us the opportunity to become familiar with concepts not possible in the physical world. It is a viewer to look towards a world of mathematical wonders "<br />
The importance, and possibility, of generating simulations comes hand in hand with the sociocultural changes that the digital world entails. Our relationship with the world and with ourselves is being transformed, but what implications-and what kind-does this mutation entail? If the cultural and social development continues along the current path, this platform will transform two twinned elements: new narrative schemes will be created and the experiential path will be restructured. The consequences will be multiple and the modes of affectation will be diverse. The transformation that comes with computers goes beyond programs, is distorting the way we perceive reality.<br />
In the correspondence to Louis Collet, Gustave Flaubert declares that time is measured in how long it takes for his letter to arrive, in a poetic idea that not only speaks of the impatience of lovers but of a temporal conception that seems remote, nostalgic . In 150 years, time has cracked and only leads us to ask ourselves, how long does it take to get a whatsapp?
 With the digital, the temporal multiplicity goes further. In the 21st century, time does not stop in a moment or become relativized, but a tangential transformation is created by linking, simultaneously, contexts and times, rather, the new temporality is a palimpsest of realities.<br />
However, before simulating you have to understand the model. We live a reality, we all agree on it, the problem is when we want to grasp a definition, because what is reality? It is a question that goes beyond truisms. Its definition transcends us, it is impossible to define it as an entity, and we resort to analogies or dissimilarities to apprehend it. So much so that the Royal Academy defines it in an ambiguous way, clarifying that it is "what really happens" or "the actual and effective existence of something", "as opposed to the fantastic or illusory". On the other hand, when it defines virtual reality, it has no problem in asserting that it is the "representation of scenes or images of objects produced by a computer system, which gives the sensation of its real existence" (RAE:). As it is uncomfortable for us, we could argue, as St. Augustine said of time: "If you do not ask me, I know; If they ask me, I ignore it. "
Since we can not understand reality by its meaning, let's go to its parts. One of its characteristics, or at least we will all agree, is that it is objective, it is the conception of materiality, of objects, not of subjects, because reality is not what one perceives. It is not characteristic of objects that are cold or rough, nor that are olfactory or sound, because reality is not what we perceive with the senses.<br />
Therefore, I believe that one of the best definitions was introduced by Phillip K. Dick: "Reality is what does not vanish when you stop believing in it".<br />
Under this principle, reality could be replicable. It has been tried for thousands of years. The linear narrative arts, such as the novel or the cinema, have sought to replicate it, to create in the reader the essential idea that we stop inhabiting the tangible reality to belong to a reverie. As Salvador Elizondo states in El Hipogeo Secreto "Perhaps it would be easier to write a simple book, a book that would simply describe the life of men and the lives of women, like all the books that have been written over the centuries. margin of all drunkenness or of all daydreams; that is to say, whose arguments are carefully inscribed within the limits of that supreme fallacy that is reality. "<br />
The problem is that when we read, although we immerse ourselves in an alternate world, we are aware that our reality is not transformed, not even affected to a lesser extent. I believe that none of us, all assiduous readers, believe in the quixotic idea that fiction and the tangible world mix; we are aware that our reality is not being duplicated by another, simulated, but that there is an alternate reality, with the same physical and sociocultural principles, where beings very similar to us solve conflicts so human that they allow us to empathize. Immersion is specified, but not the simulation, as Maurice Blanchot explains in The Space of Literature, when reading "someone is fascinated, it can be said that he does not perceive any real object, no real figure, because what he sees does not belong to the world of reality but to the indeterminate medium of fascination. "(Blanchot: 26)<br />
The same happens with video games, until now, where the graphics of a high immersion and the reaction of the character to the user's decisions, lead to a greater immersion, an alternate reality, defined by two rules that are similar to our reality, the objectivity of the environment and the subjectivity of the actors. The spaces are pre-established, the goals are unequivocal and, finally, a pre-established reaction that varies conform to the "decisions" that the user executes, in the same way that the reactions of the other characters that surround you vary. In spite of this, the regular game participants are aware that the game's space is simulated, that its reality remains unchanged. Regardless if they use immersive mechanisms such as the Oculus rift or increasingly interactive stories.<br />
An exemplary case of the search for duplication between real and virtual life is Second Life, a program that was launched in 2003, where people could simulate their lives through an avatar and perform activities ranging from chatting or shopping to piloting a plane or have sex with other avatars. In less than five years, the 38 thousand "residents" of Second Life, as a whole, had spent more than 8 million hours, 945 years, in this alternate world. In the following year, the number of residents increased by 232%. Today, it has more than one million permanent, regular users.<br />
But still not enough, the goal is to go beyond social collaboration or virtual reality, those visual discourses that seek interactivity and immersion without achieving the suspension of disbelief. The current mechanisms have not achieved or seek to distort the philosophical principle that reality is a construct.
The primal element, by simulating reality, is as a principle that all the elements, which are beyond us, seem to us to be as real as this reality, that we can not define but inhabit. An overlap of realities would be created. The way to achieve it is, like Borges in "The Memory of Shakespeare," "ensures that the brain of man is a palimpsest. Each new writing covers the previous writing and is covered by the one that follows, but the almighty memory can exhume any impression, however momentary it may have been, if they give it sufficient encouragement. "(Borges, 1993: 304) It is the idea of ​​the palimpsest on which the theory of simulation is built, in general.<br />
For this, computers could be the tools that will generate much more accurate simulations, in addition to the narrative and digital mechanisms that we have in the 21st century. The digital world is necessary to achieve it, what literature and cinema, in their current formats, will never conceive. And there is a generation in development that sees as an organic change the way in which the digital world has transformed our idea of ​​reality, even more than we are willing to assume.<br />
As until now reality has not been replicated, some theorists and narrative exponents have assured that it is more feasible to inhabit an already simulated reality.
From the film by the Wachoski brothers, Nick Bostrom, in 2002, he developed his essay Are you living in a computer simulation, where he explains in what sense we live, or the possibility that our reality is partly simulated. One of its three strategies is to clarify that a future civilization would have the computational capacity to create, and inhabit, simulations of its past, us.
It sounds ridiculous, though, if we analyze the advances that computers have made in the last forty years and the speed with which it will increase, as the Moore law makes clear, it is not a far-fetched theory.<br />
To recreate this reality, only the habitable, without the abyss of the universe or the hidden regions of the earth, in a constant present where the past acts as an intertext immersed in the annals and that can simulate the personal conscience of a human inhabited by that reality, it interacts superficially with other entities and has an intrinsic freedom of action, it would take around 1036 operations per second. The first supercomputer, the CDC 6600, built in 1964, reached 106, currently working on a supercomputer that achieves an exaflop, ie 1018. In fifty years, the capacity of a computer tripled, without recourse to quantum bits or transplanetary networks , feasible and increasingly closer. Bostrom's position was taken up by cosmologist Brian Green, one of the most respected scientists today, in his book The Hidden Reality, as a mathematically demonstrable, scientific possibility.<br />
Now, you do not need to simulate all the reality, only the one that impacts the main users, because one of the things that Bostrom raises is, how are you sure that the beings that surround you, that move through your life, far and silent Are you aware? or that the reality that we do not perceive, in an imitation with George Berkeley, really exists. Have any of you been to Bali PHOTOS, let's not talk about the moon? How do we know that these images are real? Let's not talk about astronomical images, constellations and galaxies that are closer to an illustration than a scientific portrait of our conception of space.<br />
However, at this moment, or it is impossible to recreate reality, what I believe, or is a fact that we inhabit a simulated reality, an idea that does not differ much from the religious conception that the deity created a world and perceives it in simultaneity , as a temporary aleph.<br />
If they were created in a simulation, our posthuman descendants could inhabit different scenarios and function for a while as one of us, as stipulated in the film The 13 floor, also from 1999.
Now, simulating a reality goes further. As Jean Baudrillard clarifies in Cultura y simulacro, "the impossibility of staging the illusion, is of the same type as the impossibility of rescuing an absolute level of reality. The illusion is no longer possible because reality is not either "(Baudrillard: 47).<br />
My position is that, until now, simulations of reality are unsuccessful because users never break the principle of the suspension of disbelief. All, without counting the neurological delusions, we believe that we inhabit a reality and that the fictionalization of that reality is an immersive fiction, not a substitution. Although digital mechanisms are increasingly closer to what we consider reality. If we start that video games will be seen in one or two years, thanks to the program Unreal engine VIDEO ANIMATION, maybe our perception of reality is less real than we think.<br />
In the dream something similar happens, our brain simulates a reality and experience, because the amygdala provokes emotions, such as fear or excitement, which produces "apparent sensory impressions", as Dr. Allan Hobson of the Faculty of Harvard Medicine, by generating false sensations that are generated in our interior, we listen, we see and we feel, even though our body is apart. This, together with the narrative guidelines of the dream that defy logic, involve the sensation of reality and presence in totality, closer to the simulation of experience, but with a process of total immersion, as is sought in the simulation of the reality.<br />
Now, if we manage to simulate realities, that would give rise to that great historical simulation, we could recreate worlds in a mise in perfect abyme, where at some point we would not be fully aware of what is the real reality and what the duplicated reality. For this we can consider, if reality is virtual, because virtuality can not be real?
Another point raised by Bostrom and Green is, yes, there is a future civilization that can simulate any circumstance or reality, because they would recreate this, as imperfect, or maybe it happens as Borges clarifies in "Del rigor en la ciencia":<br />
[...] the Colleges of Cartographers erected a Map of the Empire, which had the Size of the Empire and coincided punctually with it. Less Addicted to the Study of Cartography, the Next Generations understood that this dilated Map was useless and not without Impiety they gave it to the Inclemencies of the Sun and the Winters.<br />
On this, we come to the second, fundamental point, if reality is "what does not disappear when you stop believing in it", what matters to us is what we inhabit, the perception of it, our experience.<br />
Experience is the connection with reality based on observation and participation. This connection is generated through our senses, the way in which we link with the environment and our preconceptions.<br />
The problem is that we can not trust our senses in their entirety. As Rene Descartes says in his "Metaphysical Meditations": "Everything I have admitted up to the present as safer and more true, I have learned from the senses or the senses; Now, I have sometimes experienced that such senses deceived me, and it is prudent never to trust entirely those who have deceived us once. "
If you can, close your eyes, for a second, and contain the sense that allows us, or so we believe, to recognize reality. AUDIO TRAFFIC<br />
If reality is what surrounds us, we would be, at this moment, on a busy street, with hundreds of cars around us, or behind us, so, your brain, having your eyes closed, should release adrenaline in sufficient quantities so that they do not run over us. They will realize that our senses are manipulable. If we distrust our sense of hearing, then we can not trust that we know reality.<br />
Experience has been seen as what we collect through ideas or the senses; in either of the two forms we speak of the configuration of reality as an entity perceived through the mind. And the mind can be manipulated with narrative strategies and by itself. The aim is to understand these transformations of the mind in order to recreate simulations of experience in the user.
From the point of view of the philosophical hermeneutics (Gadamer), only experiences are possible if you have expectations, that is why a person of experience is not the one who has accumulated more experiences (Erlebnis), but the one who is qualified to allow it (Wikipedia : experience)<br />
As the psychologist Daniel Kanhemann clarifies, Nobel Prize for economics, we are split into an entity that experiences life and another that remembers it, which alternate, although, as the conference clarifies "the enigma of experience versus memory", "We do not really choose between experiences, we choose between the memories of the experience. And even when we think about the future, we do not normally think about our future in terms of experiences. We think about our future in terms of anticipated memories. "This is fundamental, since what should be simulated in the user is not the experience itself, but rather a memory of a fictitious experience. This is, not only possible, but daily. Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, specialist in the acquisition of false memories, specifies that we all narrate events that may not have occurred (false memory exercise and perspective when remembering). So the main tool of experience simulation, is to generate an experience that becomes a simulated memory in the user.<br />
Now, what does it take to generate an experience? Link the fictional world with the real one and give the user the ability to choose. To the intermediate points he generates meaning. Take, for example, the digital experience of the loving link through the internet. Either the link with a machine, as in the movie Her () to the link between people with a digital application in between. The year ancestor came out one of the most famous applications today, Tinder, and in less than a year got 450 million rejections and emotional links between users, up to date. Now, people fall in love through these means, without physical contact, only by words that the brain decodes by its own voice, in an interesting narcissistic game, and with a non-spontaneous response time, following the advice of Ovid, "persuade yourself of that you are in love and you will be an eloquent lover. " Love is complex, it involves emotions, sex is not, it is an experience.<br />
Sex is the most successful simulation of the decade. If we use the simplest, grossest example, that is, pornography, we can understand the desire to simulate experiences in the network. Virtual sex is safe, in the time of AIDS, emotional bonding is not necessary and it is direct, pleasure for pleasure, nothing more. This has generated 40% of the network, ie one million 400 thousand pages, are pornographic and transit through different levels of interaction, from erotic videochats to mechanical onanist games with viewers in 3D graphics, to fulfill what Baudrillard dictated. "Disappointed simulation: porn, truer than real, such is the height of the simulacrum.<br /><br />

To simulate an experience, not only are narrative and digital strategies necessary, but psychological and physical ones that allow linking realities. That the user convert their experience of reality in a simulation and the simulation the tie with the reality, until breaking the increasingly feeble line that separates the fiction of the reality, because as it clarifies Jorge Luis Borges in "partial Magic of the Quijote": "Why are we concerned that Don Quixote is a reader of Hamlet's Don Quixote and Hamlet? I think I have found the cause: such investments suggest that if the characters of a fiction can be readers or spectators, we their readers or spectators can be fictitious. "Or, the simulated experiences are not only real, but they become a memory. .<br /><br />

The moment artificial intelligence allows us to create simulations in a not only organic but instantaneous way, the function of simulations as generators of an experience, or of an alternative life, the narrative functions will become as important as the vital ones. For the moment, we have to adjust to the current, common elements, to create a strategy that allows us to simulate in the most plausible way possible and to search that with the current technological implementations new aesthetic ideas are generated. Currently, hypertext support allows us to create a new narrative discipline that brings together various artistic branches and multimedia elements -videos, audio, literary and informational texts, images and hyperlinks to other platforms such as videogames, chats, social networks, use of a microphone, camera, gyroscope, gps, elements that interact with the touch screen and metatextual links, among others - around a narrative that generates an experience in the user and mutes in memory.<br />
With the appearance of new technological ideas, such as google glass or immersive tools, the possibility of linking realities will be easier and more fruitful every day. Taking advantage of them, from the narrative notion, will allow us to generate experiences in the user that in their daily life could never perform, such as having the impression that they traveled to space or, as it is being tested by the School of Psychology of the UNAM, eliminate phobias.<br />
JG Ballard in the prologue to his novel Crash stated: "" I feel that the balance between fiction and reality has changed significantly in the last decade, quickly their roles have been reversed [...] We live in a novel. that man invent a fictional content, fiction is already there, the task of the writer is to invent reality. "<br />
We know each other through language, for this reason man and his environment is a lexical product, a metaphorical approach to reality, a resignification of the world and its temporal dimension (the past can only be reconstructed by the imagination, the present is understood as resignificarlo and the future is a lexical projection), as well as the enlargement of our horizon, impoverished by everyday life. As Paul Ricoeur clarified, "what is communicated, in the final analysis, is, beyond the meaning of the work, the world that projects and constitutes its horizon" (148).<br />
In life, the work is projected, it is built in reflection on a cave, as in the Platonic allegory, with shadows in the form of signs and glossaries. Every time we decipher a narration, in whatever format, we capture what our mind seeks to interpret, in an open manner, as Umberto Eco clarifies; the reader is only an interpreter of a work in the sense that it alters the elements that the author proposes, with his preconceptions, and visualizes the words in a unique and unrepeatable sense, although this does not make him a co-creator because he does not transform the inalterable essence of the text. Neither its interaction with reality, only its conception of it.<br />
Even with these elements, the way to simulate reality, until now, has been based on narrations. "Reading, said Ezra Pound, is an art of replication. Sometimes readers live in a parallel world and sometimes imagine that this world enters reality "(Piglia,: 12) This process is the basic principle of simulation as it has been understood, until now.<br />
In addition, finding the keys and mechanisms to create simulations of experience, from the cognitive functions and not the technological materiality would allow people to create their own simulations, share them in a network of experiences that would transform our notion of experience as a unique situation , this would generate an empathic network and perhaps contribute to a transformation of our notion of the livable and the experimental.<br />
Unlike what Robert Nozik states, the purpose of this type of simulations is not to replace reality but to increase the vital sensation of the experience. In a simulation, everything can happen, even physically impossible, and the user can be whoever they want.<br />
Luis Buñuel determined that the cinema of the future was the one that was projected from the mind to the wall, not from the screen to the brain.
